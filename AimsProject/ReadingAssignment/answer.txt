- When should accessor methods be used?
Based on Allen Holub's article, accessor methods (getters and setters) should be used sparingly. They can lead to tight coupling (changes affect many classes) and brittle code (less flexible to class-related changes). Instead, it's often better to use parameterized constructors (use parameters to initialize) and factory methods (static) to control object creation and initialization. Accessors should only be used when you need to expose internal state without exposing implementation details.

- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
No, Java won't allow it. Constructor overloading needs different parameter types, not just names. Use unique data types (e.g., String for title, int for category ID) to create separate constructors.
