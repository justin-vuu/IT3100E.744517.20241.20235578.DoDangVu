1. The Media class should implement the Comparable interface because Media is the base class for all types of media DVD, CD, Book -> all class have natural ordering.

2. 
@Override
public int compareTo(Media other) {
    int titleComparison = this.title.compareToIgnoreCase(other.title);
    if (titleComparison != 0) {
        return titleComparison; 
    }
    return Float.compare(this.cost, other.cost); 
}
3. No. Comparable interface allows 1 ordering only because only have 1 compareTo() method in a class.
