1. Why getter and setter methods are evil?
	1.1. Violation of Encapsulation
	1.2. Limits Flexibility for Future Changes
	1.3. Pushes Data Handling Outside the Object: Accessor methods often result
	 in external manipulation of data, which should ideally be managed internally within the object.
	1.4. Leads to Uncontrolled Access and Unsafe Data Usage
2. If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build 
a DVD by category.Does JAVA allow you to do this?

This feature is known as constructor overloading.
